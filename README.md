-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room offers the game Draw it or Lose on Android and they would like to scale and offer the game for more operating systems. The game is web-based and it requires a large library of images as well as the ability to support multiple players and teams.

-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think particularly well on the development requirements, I enjoyed doing my own research to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each operating system when it came to our particular case.
 
-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I think working through a design document helps divide the problem into smaller pieces and to identify a starting point, in this case, a system to first start development. 

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to improve my final recommendations, in order to analyze how would the recommended system process the storage management in depth.

-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user needs are the guide of what needs to be done. In my case, I implemented it into my software design by ensuring my research was focused around said needs. If we don't consider user needs when making a project, then we are disregarding the main objective of the project, as we develop for people/users.

-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach was to divide the design into smaller pieces. My main strategy was to do the research for each point on all the operative systems, in order to see the contrast and similarities among them.
